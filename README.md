Python chess engine with intention of minimizing hard-coded PSTs and other non-intuitive evaluation methods (this is however proving difficult in mop-up situations, this will hopefully be fixed when king-safty heuristic is implemented). Goal is to create as strong of an engine via efficient searching and intuitive static eval methods. Hopefully this experiment will better inform me on what exactly helps make an entity strong at chess and help me evaluate where my weaknesses lie.
